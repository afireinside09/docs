## Your First AI Formula

After [installing SheetMagic](/guides/installation), you're ready to use AI in your spreadsheet.

### Generate Text

Type this formula in any cell:

```
=AITEXT("Write a product description for wireless earbuds")
```

The AI will generate a professional product description directly in your cell.

### Generate a List

Create a vertical list of items:

```
=AILIST("5 marketing strategies for a new app")
```

Each strategy appears in a separate cell below the formula.

### Use Cell References

Combine AI with your existing data:

```
=AITEXT("Summarize this article: " & A1)
```

The AI will summarize whatever content is in cell A1.

## Common Use Cases

### Content Generation

<CodeGroup>
```text Blog Ideas
=AILIST("10 blog post ideas about sustainable living")
```

```text Social Media Posts
=AITEXT("Write a Twitter post announcing a product launch for: " & A1)
```

```text Email Templates
=AITEXT("Write a professional follow-up email for a sales meeting")
```
</CodeGroup>

### Data Analysis

<CodeGroup>
```text Sentiment Analysis
=AITEXT("Analyze the sentiment of this review: " & A1)
```

```text Data Extraction
=AITEXT("Extract the email address from this text: " & A1)
```

```text Categorization
=AITEXT("Categorize this product into one of these categories: Electronics, Clothing, Food, Other. Product: " & A1)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Web Research

<CodeGroup>
```text Page Content
=VISIT("https://example.com/article")
```

```text Search Results
=SERP("best project management tools 2024", 5)
```

```text Page Metadata
=GETMETATITLE("https://example.com")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Working with Multiple Cells

### Process Multiple Rows

1. Enter your data in column A
2. Write your formula in B1: `=AITEXT("Translate to Spanish: " & A1)`
3. Drag the formula down to process all rows

### Bulk Operations

For large datasets, SheetMagic processes formulas asynchronously. Results appear as each request completes.

<Tip>
Start with a small batch to estimate processing time before running on thousands of rows.
