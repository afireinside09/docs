## What Are Seats?

Seats allow you to share your SheetMagic license with other users. Each seat grants one person access to use SheetMagic under your license.

## How Seats Work

1. You purchase a license with a specific number of seats
2. You assign seats to team members by email
3. Each assigned user can use SheetMagic with your license

<Note>
Lifetime licenses include 1 seat by default. Subscription licenses can include multiple seats.
</Note>

## Managing Seats

### View Current Seats

1. Log in to [sheetmagic.ai/dashboard](https://sheetmagic.ai/dashboard)
2. Navigate to your license
3. View the Seats section

You'll see:
- Total seats available
- Active seats
- Available slots
- List of assigned emails

### Add a Seat

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Dashboard">
    Log in to your SheetMagic dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select License">
    Click on the license you want to manage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Seat">
    Click **Add Seat** and enter the user's email.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    The user can now use SheetMagic with your license.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Remove a Seat

1. Go to your license in the dashboard
2. Find the seat to remove
3. Click **Revoke** next to the email
4. Confirm removal

<Warning>
Revoking a seat immediately removes access. The user will need a new license to continue using SheetMagic.
</Warning>

### Transfer a Seat

To transfer a seat to a different email:

1. Go to your license in the dashboard
2. Find the seat to transfer
3. Click **Transfer**
4. Enter the new email address
5. Confirm the transfer

The old email loses access immediately, and the new email gains access.

## Seat Limits

| License Type | Default Seats |
|--------------|---------------|
| Lifetime | 1 |
| Monthly | Based on plan |
| Annual | Based on plan |

### Increasing Seats

For subscription licenses:
1. Go to **Manage Subscription** in dashboard
2. Upgrade to a higher seat count
3. Changes apply immediately (prorated)

<Note>
Lifetime licenses cannot add additional seats. Consider purchasing additional licenses for team members.
</Note>

## Team Setup

### For License Owner

1. Purchase a license with enough seats
2. Assign seats to team members via email
3. Share the license key with your team

### For Team Members

4. Start using SheetMagic

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I change who uses a seat?">
    Yes, use the Transfer feature to change the email associated with a seat without losing the seat.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens when I remove a seat?">
    The user immediately loses access. Their SheetMagic formulas will stop working until they have a valid license.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can one person use multiple seats?">
    No, each seat is tied to one email address. The same person doesn't need multiple seats.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do seats work across different spreadsheets?">
    Yes, once assigned, a seat works in any Google Sheets document for that user.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I temporarily revoke and re-add seats?">
    Yes, but revoked seats count against your limit. You can revoke and reassign as needed.
  </Accordion>

## Seat Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Active | User can access SheetMagic |
| Revoked | Access removed, seat available for reassignment |

## Best Practices

### For Teams

- Assign seats only to active users
- Revoke seats when team members leave
- Use transfer instead of revoke+add for changes
- Keep track of who has seats assigned

### For Agencies

- Assign seats to client-facing team members
- Use separate licenses for different clients
- Monitor usage through the dashboard

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Can't add seat | Check if you have available slots |
| User can't access | Verify their email matches exactly |
| Seat not working | Have user re-enter license key |
| Ran out of seats | Upgrade subscription or purchase additional license |
