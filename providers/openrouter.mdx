## Overview

OpenRouter provides access to over 100 AI models from multiple providers through a single API. This is ideal if you want to experiment with different models or need access to models not directly supported by SheetMagic.

## Getting an API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Account">
    Go to [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) and sign up.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Credits">
    Add credits to your account (various payment methods supported).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Key">
    Navigate to Keys and create a new API key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy Key">
    Copy your API key for use in SheetMagic.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How It Works

OpenRouter acts as a proxy to multiple AI providers:

1. You send a request to OpenRouter
2. OpenRouter routes to the appropriate provider
3. Response is returned through OpenRouter

Benefits:
- Single API key for multiple providers
- Unified billing
- Automatic fallbacks
- Model comparison

## Available Models

OpenRouter provides access to models from:

| Provider | Example Models |
|----------|----------------|
| OpenAI | GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo |
| Anthropic | Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus |
| Google | Gemini Pro, Gemini Flash |
| Meta | Llama 3, Llama 2 |
| Mistral | Mistral Large, Mixtral |
| Cohere | Command R+ |
| And many more... | 100+ models |

## Text Generation

OpenRouter supports all text generation functions:

```
=AITEXT("Your prompt here")
=AILIST("Generate a list of...")
```

Models are selected based on your configuration or automatically chosen.

## Image Generation

OpenRouter supports image generation through compatible models:

```
=AIIMAGE("A beautiful sunset over mountains")
```

**Supported Aspect Ratios:**
- 1:1 (square)
- 16:9 (landscape)
- 9:16 (portrait)
- 4:3, 3:4
- 21:9, 9:21

## Special Model Handling

### Search Models

Models with search capabilities:
- `gpt-4o-search`
- `gpt-4o-mini-search`

<Note>
Search models don't support temperature. SheetMagic automatically omits this parameter.
</Note>

### Reasoning Models

O-series models through OpenRouter:
- `o1`, `o1-mini`
- `o3`, `o3-mini`

These use `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`.

## Configuration

### Model Selection

Select models by ID in your OpenRouter configuration. Common choices:

| Use Case | Recommended Model |
|----------|-------------------|
| General | openai/gpt-4o |
| Fast | openai/gpt-4o-mini |
| Complex | anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet |
| Creative | anthropic/claude-3-opus |
| Budget | meta-llama/llama-3-8b |

### Temperature

Supported for most models (0-2):

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| 0.0 - 0.3 | Consistent |
| 0.7 | Balanced |
| 1.0+ | Creative |

## Advantages

- **Variety**: Access to 100+ models
- **Single Key**: One API key for everything
- **Fallbacks**: Automatic failover if a model is down
- **Cost Comparison**: See pricing across providers
- **New Models**: Quick access to newly released models
- **No Multi-Account**: Don't need accounts with each provider

## Use Cases

### Model Comparison

Test different models on the same task:

| Prompt | GPT-4o Result | Claude Result | Llama Result |
|--------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Cost Optimization

Route to cheaper models for simple tasks, premium models for complex ones.

### Experimentation

Try new models without creating new provider accounts.

## Pricing

OpenRouter pricing includes:
- Per-token costs (varies by model)
- Small markup over direct provider pricing
- Unified billing

View model pricing at [openrouter.ai/docs#models](https://openrouter.ai/docs#models).

<Tip>
OpenRouter shows real-time pricing for each model, making it easy to choose cost-effective options.

## Limitations

- Small markup over direct API pricing
- Some provider-specific features may not be available
- Rate limits may differ from direct access

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Model not found | Check model ID spelling |
| Rate limited | Check OpenRouter dashboard for limits |
| High latency | Try a different model or provider |
| Credits exhausted | Add more credits to account |
