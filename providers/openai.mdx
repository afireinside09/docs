## Text Models

### Standard Models

| Model | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| gpt-4o | Latest flagship model | General purpose, balanced |
| gpt-4o-mini | Fast, cost-effective | High volume, simple tasks |
| gpt-4-turbo | Previous generation | Legacy compatibility |
| gpt-3.5-turbo | Older model | Basic tasks, lowest cost |

### Advanced Models

| Model | Description | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| gpt-5 | Next-generation | Web search capability |
| gpt-5-pro | Premium variant | Enhanced capabilities |
| o1 | Reasoning model | No temperature support |
| o3 | Advanced reasoning | No temperature support |
| o3-mini | Compact reasoning | Fast reasoning |

### Reasoning Models

The o-series models (o1, o3, o3-mini) are designed for complex reasoning tasks:

<Note>
Reasoning models don't support the temperature parameter. They use a fixed reasoning approach.
</Note>

```
=AITEXT("Solve this logic puzzle: ...")
```

### Deep Research Models

| Model | Description | Min Tokens |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| o3-deep-research | Comprehensive research | 16,000 |
| o4-mini-deep-research | Compact research | 8,000 |

Deep research models have built-in web search and require higher token budgets.

## Image Models

### DALL-E 3

The primary image generation model:

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| Sizes | 1024x1024, 1792x1024, 1024x1792 |
| Quality | Standard, HD |

```
=AIIMAGE("A serene mountain landscape at sunset, photorealistic")
```

### GPT-Image-1

Advanced image generation:

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| Sizes | 1024x1024, 1536x1024, 1024x1536, auto |
| Quality | Low, Medium, High |
| Formats | PNG, JPEG, WebP |

### DALL-E 2

Legacy model with smaller size options:

| Sizes |
|-------|
| 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024 |

## Speech Models

### OpenAI TTS

Convert text to natural-sounding speech:

```
=AISPEECH("Welcome to our presentation", "nova")
```

**Available Voices:**

| Voice | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| alloy | Neutral, balanced |
| ash | Clear, confident |
| ballad | Expressive, melodic |
| coral | Warm, friendly |
| echo | Warm, conversational |
| fable | Expressive, storytelling |
| nova | Friendly, upbeat |
| onyx | Deep, authoritative |
| sage | Wise, measured |
| shimmer | Clear, professional |
| verse | Dynamic, engaging |

## Video Models

### Sora 2

Generate videos from text descriptions:

```
=AIVIDEO("A coffee cup with steam rising, morning light, slow motion")
```

| Model | Quality | Access |
|-------|---------|--------|
| sora-2 | Standard | Requires verification |
| sora-2-pro | Premium | Requires verification |

<Warning>
Sora requires organization verification. Check your OpenAI account for eligibility.
</Warning>

## Vision (GPTV)

Analyze images with GPT-4 Vision:

```
=GPTV("https://example.com/chart.png", "Extract data from this chart")
```

Requirements:
- GPT-4o or compatible model selected
- Publicly accessible image URL

## Configuration Tips

### Temperature

| Value | Behavior | Use Case |
|-------|----------|----------|
| 0.0 - 0.3 | Deterministic | Data extraction, classification |
| 0.4 - 0.7 | Balanced | General content |
| 0.8 - 1.0 | Creative | Brainstorming, creative writing |

<Note>
Reasoning models (o1, o3) don't use temperature.
</Note>

### Max Tokens

| Task | Recommended |
|------|-------------|
| Short answers | 256 |
| Paragraphs | 512-1000 |
| Long content | 2000-4000 |

## Pricing Tiers

OpenAI pricing varies by model and usage. Key factors:
- Input tokens (your prompt)
- Output tokens (AI response)
- Image generation (per image)
- Audio generation (per character)
- Video generation (per video)

Check [OpenAI Pricing](https://openai.com/pricing) for current rates.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Rate limit errors | Reduce request frequency or upgrade tier |
| Invalid API key | Regenerate key in OpenAI dashboard |
| Model not available | Check account tier and access |
| Sora not working | Verify organization verification status |
