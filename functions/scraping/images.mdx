title: "GETIMG"
description: "Extract all image URLs from a webpage"
---

## Syntax

```
=GETIMG(url)
```

## Parameters

<ParamField path="url" type="string | cell reference" required>
  The URL of the webpage to extract images from.
</ParamField>

## Returns

A vertical list of image URLs found on the page.

## Example

```
=GETIMG("https://example.com/gallery")
```

**Result:**
| Cell | Image URL |
|------|-----------|
| A1 | https://example.com/images/photo1.jpg |
| A2 | https://example.com/images/photo2.png |
| A3 | https://cdn.example.com/banner.webp |

## Features

- Extracts URLs from `src` attributes
- Handles `srcset` for responsive images (selects largest)
- Supports `data-src` for lazy-loaded images
- Resolves relative URLs to absolute
- Maximum 1000 images per page

## Use Cases

### Content Inventory

Catalog all images on a website:

| URL | Images |
|-----|--------|
| `https://site.com/page1` | `=GETIMG(A1)` |
| `https://site.com/page2` | `=GETIMG(A2)` |

### Competitor Research

Analyze competitor visual content:

```
=GETIMG("https://competitor.com/products")
```

### Asset Auditing

Check image usage across pages:

```
=GETIMG(A1)
```

### Image Analysis with AI

Combine with GPTV to analyze discovered images:

```
=GPTV(GETIMG(A1), "Describe this image")
```

## Handling Image Types

GETIMG extracts URLs for all standard image formats:

| Format | Extension |
|--------|-----------|
| JPEG | .jpg, .jpeg |
| PNG | .png |
| GIF | .gif |
| WebP | .webp |
| SVG | .svg |
| BMP | .bmp |

## Responsive Images

For images with `srcset`, GETIMG automatically selects the largest available size.

```html
<!-- Source HTML -->
<img srcset="small.jpg 480w, medium.jpg 800w, large.jpg 1200w">
```

**Result:** Returns `large.jpg` (the largest option)

## Lazy-Loaded Images

GETIMG handles common lazy-loading patterns:

- `data-src` attribute
- `data-srcset` attribute
- `data-lazy-src` attribute

## Displaying Images in Sheets

Use Google Sheets' IMAGE function to display extracted images:

```
=IMAGE(B1)
```

Where B1 contains an image URL from GETIMG.

### Creating an Image Gallery

| A (URL) | B (Image URLs) | C (Display) |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| `https://...` | `=GETIMG(A1)` | `=IMAGE(B1)` |

## Filtering Images

### By File Type

Use FILTER to get only specific image types:

```
=FILTER(GETIMG(A1), REGEXMATCH(GETIMG(A1), "\.jpg$"))
```

### By Size (filename patterns)

```
=FILTER(GETIMG(A1), REGEXMATCH(GETIMG(A1), "large|full|original"))
```

## Tips for Better Results

### 1. Use Gallery or Product Pages

Pages designed to display images yield better results:

```
// Better
=GETIMG("https://store.com/products/category")

// Less useful
=GETIMG("https://store.com/about")
```

### 2. Check for CDN URLs

Many sites serve images from CDNs with different domains:

```
// Results may include:
// - https://example.com/images/...
// - https://cdn.example.com/...
// - https://img.cloudprovider.com/...
```

### 3. Handle Dynamic Content

For sites with infinite scroll or lazy loading, only initially loaded images are captured.

## Limitations

- Maximum 1000 images per page
- JavaScript-rendered images may not be captured
- Some sites serve images with authentication
- Background images in CSS are not extracted
- Data URIs (base64) are not included

## Error Handling

```
=IFERROR(GETIMG(A1), "Could not extract images")
```

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Empty result | No images or dynamic loading | Try different page |
| Broken URLs | Relative paths not resolved | Usually resolved automatically |
| Missing images | CSS backgrounds | Use GETSELECTOR for specific elements |
