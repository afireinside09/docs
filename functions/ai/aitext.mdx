## Processing at Scale

When processing multiple rows:

1. Write your formula in the first cell
2. Drag the formula down to apply to more rows
3. SheetMagic processes requests asynchronously

<Tip>
For large batches, start with 10-20 rows to estimate completion time before processing thousands of cells.
</Tip>

## Model Selection

The AI model used depends on your [configuration](/guides/configuration). Different models have different strengths:

| Model | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| GPT-4o | General-purpose, balanced quality/speed |
| GPT-4o-mini | Fast responses, lower cost |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Complex reasoning, nuanced writing |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | Quick responses, Google ecosystem |
