</CodeGroup>

## Writing Effective Prompts

### Be Specific About Output Format

<CodeGroup>
```text List Format
=GPTV(A1, "List all products visible in this image, one per line")
```

=GPTV(A1, "Extract name, price, and color as JSON")
```

```text Single Word
=GPTV(A1, "What is the dominant color? Answer with one word only")
```
</CodeGroup>

### Ask Focused Questions

```
=GPTV(A1, "How many people are in this image?")
```

### Request Comparisons

```
=GPTV(A1, "Compare this product image to typical competitor products in terms of design")
```

## Supported Image Types

| Format | Supported |
|--------|-----------|
| JPEG | Yes |
| PNG | Yes |
| GIF | Yes (first frame) |
| WebP | Yes |
| BMP | Yes |

## URL Requirements

The image URL must be:
- Publicly accessible (no authentication required)
- Direct link to an image file
- HTTPS preferred for security

### Working with Google Drive Images

For images in Google Drive, use the direct download URL format:
```
https://drive.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID
```

## Batch Processing

Analyze multiple images efficiently:

| A (Image URL) | B (Analysis) |
|---------------|--------------|
| `https://...image1.jpg` | `=GPTV(A1, "Describe this")` |
| `https://...image2.jpg` | `=GPTV(A2, "Describe this")` |

## Tips for Better Results

### 1. Zoom In on Details

For detailed analysis, use cropped or zoomed images:

```
=GPTV(A1, "Read the text on the product label")
```

### 2. Provide Context

```
=GPTV(A1, "This is a photo of our store. Count the number of customers visible")
```

### 3. Handle Uncertainty

```
=GPTV(A1, "If you can identify the brand, name it. If not, respond 'Unknown'")
```

## Limitations

- Image must be publicly accessible via URL
- Large images may be resized
- Some image content may be restricted
- Analysis quality depends on image clarity
- OpenAI provider only
